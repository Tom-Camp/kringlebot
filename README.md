# Kringlebot

I come from a family of six kids. My parents didn't want us to try and buy a 
gift for all of our siblings, so they went with the Kris Kringle method of 
picking names so that each person in the family only had to buy one gift for 
one person. For years we drew names out of hat, but now we are scattered across
 the country and married. The Kringlebot is a Python script that associates 
 Kris Kringles with the person to whom they will be giving a gift. It will 
 generate a json file with the Kringle and recipient for every year so that 
 there will be a historical record and so Kringles won't have the same 
 recipients two years in a row. It can also be configured so that spouses won't
  get their spouse because, I assume, they are already getting something 
  spectacular for them.

## Installation
The Kringlebot is designed to be run in a terminal. There is no installation 
needed.

## Implementation
To run, enter the **/kringle** directory and run `./startup.py`. If this is 
your first time running the bot you will be required to enter names of 
participants. You will be able to edit or add more participants at any time 
until you have generated the Kris Kringle list.

Once you have added participants you can associate the participants with their
 spouses, assuming their spouses were added as participants. Like the 
 participants list, you will be able to edit or update the list until Kringle 
 list is generated.
